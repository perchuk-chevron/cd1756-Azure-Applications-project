# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

I chose the App Service option because this project was fairly simple and the focus was on developing and lauching the app, not on the infrastucture itself.

If I had to do it on a VM, it would probably take longer and cost more, wich in this case would not be worth it.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

For more complex projects that require a more customized installation and greater control over the infrastructure, I would choose the VM option.
This would also apply in cases where more resources are used that do not exist as services in Azure.
